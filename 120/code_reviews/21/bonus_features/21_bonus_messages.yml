  Welcome to Twenty-One Card Game!

  => You will be playing against the computer (dealer) for multiple rounds.
  => Each player is initially dealt two cards. The dealer's cards have one face up.
  => You have the choice to maintain your hand (stay), and not draw any cards.
  => You are also allowed to draw additional cards (hit) to improve your hand.

  => Here is how the card value is determined:
    - The numbers 2 through 10 are worth their face value.
    - The Jack, Queen, and King are each worth 10.
    - The Ace can be worth 1 or 11.
    - If the total value does not exceed 21, each Ace is worth 11.
    - If the total value exceeds 21, each Ace is worth 1.

  => Round winner is the one whose total card value is higher than the other player's.
  => However, a player with a total card value higher than 21 loses the current round.
  => Whichever player reaches a score of %{sub1} first is the grand winner.
