# Object Oriented Programming



## Summary

Object oriented programming is at the heart of Ruby, and in this course we'll work on demystifying OOP and how to code in an OO fashion. We'll cover topics such as inheritance and encapsulation and get at the core of what Ruby programming is about. You'll be challenged to debug and design several non-trivial OO programs. After this course, you should know: classes and objects, instance variables, class variables, instance methods, class methods, class inheritance, working with collaborator objects, and many other basic OO concepts.

#### Major Topics

- What classes and objects are
- How class inheritance works in Ruby
- How Ruby deals with multiple inheritance
- Class vs instance methods and variables
- Working with object oriented code
- Design considerations when working with OOP
- Object "truthiness"
- Object equivalence
- Fake operators in Ruby
- Debugging OO code
- Reading OO code
- Working with collaborator objects
- Modules
- Using CRC cards to guide design
- Over a dozen OO exercises
- Five large OO projects
