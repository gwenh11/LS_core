# 8. Alphabetical Numbers

Write a method that takes an Array of Integers between 0 and 19, and returns an Array of those Integers sorted based on the English words for each number:

zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen

Examples:
```ruby
alphabetic_number_sort((0..19).to_a) == [
  8, 18, 11, 15, 5, 4, 14, 9, 19, 1, 7, 17,
  6, 16, 10, 13, 3, 12, 2, 0
]
```

**Further Exploration**

Why do you think we didn't use Array#sort_by! instead of Enumerable#sort_by?

sort_by! {|obj| block} → ary
sort_by! → Enumerator
Sorts self in place using a set of keys generated by mapping the values in self through the given block.

**The result is not guaranteed to be stable. When two keys are equal, the order of the corresponding elements is unpredictable.**

If no block is given, an Enumerator is returned instead.

For an extra challenge, rewrite your method to use Enumerable#sort (unless you already did so).

```ruby
NUMBER_WORDS = %w(zero one two three four
                  five six seven eight nine
                  ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen
                  fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen)

def alphabetic_number_sort(numbers)
  numbers.sort { |num1, num2| NUMBER_WORDS[num1] <=> NUMBER_WORDS[num2] }
end
```

**LS Solution**

```ruby
NUMBER_WORDS = %w(zero one two three four
                  five six seven eight nine
                  ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen
                  fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen)

def alphabetic_number_sort(numbers)
  numbers.sort_by { |number| NUMBER_WORDS[number] }
end
