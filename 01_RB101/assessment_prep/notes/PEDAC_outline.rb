Tips:
- **Test frequently!**
- Verbalize expected return value before testing codes
- Methods should do only one thing: return something or output something. Keep at same level.
- Consistent name scheme: methods should be verbs. if it has output, indicate what that output is(print_names). 
- Are you keeping track of return value or not? (retrieve_names vs. print_names). If mutating, use bang symbol.
