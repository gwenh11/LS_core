=begin
You have the following classes.

class Person
  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  private

  def gait
    "strolls"
  end
end

class Cat
  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  private

  def gait
    "saunters"
  end
end

class Cheetah
  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  private

  def gait
    "runs"
  end
end

You need to modify the code so that this works:

mike = Person.new("Mike")
mike.walk
# => "Mike strolls forward"

kitty = Cat.new("Kitty")
kitty.walk
# => "Kitty saunters forward"

flash = Cheetah.new("Flash")
flash.walk
# => "Flash runs forward"

You are only allowed to write one new method to do this.
=end

module Walkable
  def walk
    "#{name} #{gait} forward"
  end
end

class Person
  attr_reader :name

  include Walkable

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  private

  def gait
    "strolls"
  end
end

class Cat
  attr_reader :name

  include Walkable

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  private

  def gait
    "saunters"
  end
end

class Cheetah
  attr_reader :name

  include Walkable

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  private

  def gait
    "runs"
  end
end

mike = Person.new("Mike")
p mike.walk
# => "Mike strolls forward"

kitty = Cat.new("Kitty")
p kitty.walk
# => "Kitty saunters forward"

flash = Cheetah.new("Flash")
p flash.walk
# => "Flash runs forward"

=begin
You can use the Walkable module as a mixin with any class 
that defines gait and name. You can also define a parent class
and make the other classes inherit from that class.

While it is sometimes tricky to choose one or the other, 
a great guideline is to decide if you want some 
additional functionality, or if you want to extend 
the abilities of the class. In this case, it is pretty clear 
that we need the functionality of walking; we don't need to 
extend the abilities of class Person(extending the abilities 
of a class coincides with an is-a relationship, not has-a).
