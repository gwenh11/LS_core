# 1. Class and Instance Methods

Locate the ruby documentation for methods `File::path` and `File#path`. How are they different?

### **Solution**

Both methods are found on ruby docs page for `File` class in the Core API section. `File::path` is a class method. `File#path` is an instance method. Class methods are called on the class, while **instance methods** are called on **objects**.
